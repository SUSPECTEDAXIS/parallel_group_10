First to be able to run this main.rs rust file u will need to have install rust using this website https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust this will set u up perfectly with a mainrs. You will want to obviously build it with cargo build and can try to debug it first so it can set that up. After that you will run this command to build it rustc main.rs if it isnt under a folder if it is under a folder and you follow the website i posted it would be rustc src\main.rs should work since it will be under the src folder and this command to run it cargo run or .\main.exe
